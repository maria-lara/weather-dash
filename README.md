# weather-dash

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a weather dashboard so any user can access current and future weather forecasts in any city. Users can acces a location's current and future temperatures, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. Users are also able to access previous searches, allowing them to easily toggle back-and-forth between cities of interest.

This planner includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. AJAX was also used to grab data from OpenWeather APIs as JSON, which was then translated over to display properly on the page for the user.

The following API's were used:
* [OpenWeather: Current Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/current)
* [OpenWeather: 5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)
* [OpenWeather: UV Index](https://openweathermap.org/api/uvi)
