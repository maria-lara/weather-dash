# weather-dash

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a weather dashboard so any user can access current and future weather forecasts in any city. Users can acces a location's current and future temperatures, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. 

This planner includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery 

The following API's were used:
* [OpenWeather: Current Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/current)
* [OpenWeather: 5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)
* [OpenWeather: UV Index](https://openweathermap.org/api/uvi)
